        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><img class="rounded mt-4 text-center w-50" src="/static/css/akash.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <p class="mt-4">Akash's story is stupendous, from the start he is a bright child be it academic activities sprot events or co-curricular activities. He ensured to use all the details of his life to start off his journey, family support, written examination & SSB Interview preparation and joining  National Defence Academy. Multiple defence exam attempts dissatisfaction with one major and foremost successful attempt in NDA was truly Akash’s expansive mental and physical strength in his approach.
            <br><br>
            The best thing about Akash is that he comes up as an all rounder approach and view a situation in a wholistic manner. The amount of persistence, perfection, patience and power required in your passion keeps you sane & clear headed. Interest in his life towards various others parts can be witnessed in his hobbies where he loves to sing, playing guitar and football which inculcated a proper balance in his life. What you feed in yourself that grows and Akash growth in Army cantonment and schooling in APS are what he is fed upon. Many inspections of officers and army personal motivated him, the drills and life style of army and the stories of valour and courage of many officers especially Captain Vikram Batra have always inspired him.
            <br><br>
            Childhood dream of becoming an army officer was only a dream where he had everything in his mind without any directional approach. Reaching towards 12th standard he gained all the valid knowledge he could from his school seniors and teachers. As his goal was clear he dedicated himself for NDA exam from 12th standard itself. He gave his first attempt and disappointments followed as he was short by 4 marks to clear the cutt-off. But he was not low from this immediatly after this he picked himslef up and started from scratch again. Again in mid of his preparation he got an opportunity for TES-42, due to this his written exams preperation was again side-traked. During that period he took a break from writtten exam preparation and focused only on SSB preparation of TES-42.
            <br><br>
            Akash went to SSB Bangalore for TES-42 and on the 5th day of interview he was declared conference out. It was disheartening for him to see all his hardwork going nothing. Here the strength of akash (to pick himself up from deserted condition is what makes him special). He took a relalxtion beak for a week and again got to track for NDA-144 exams preparations. This time he was determint to stop at no less and left no stones unturned in his prepration. He Mock tests, unsolved mistsakes, and did restless practice. Finally the he gave his exam and soon results came, this time he did no mistake and his patience and perseverance showered colors. Now a new mountain was {SSB} was standing in his way towards the accomplishment of his dreams.
            <br><br>
            Akash had an experiance of a SSB prior from TES-42 attempt and he knew things are not gonna be easy so he took help of his classmates who were gonna prepre for SSB. He made a group of productive and dedicated aspirants and stared his preparation with them. They used to sit togather from morning till evening brushing all concepts, taking each others interview and assessing one another based on performance. Soon after a period of time all the group was fully prepared and was ready to nail the opportunity. Akash took a extra mile and went to local coaching to get himself once assessed by profestionals. At last he went to SSB with a confident mindset and as expected his every failure, every lost opportunity, everything paid off and he was reccomended. Akash was one amomg the 6 successful candidates out of total 47.
            <br><br>
            The taste of victory is the sweetest when the obstacles are the toughest and challenges are the hardest and surely 47 candidates who came on the same day with Akash to SSB centre on 2nd February can answer how toughest and challenging this victory is to them. For all the aspirants’ difficulties and challenges are many but for achievers difficulties and challenges give you strength. Akash victory is solely his hard work and strength with proper assurance and guidance.. </p>
