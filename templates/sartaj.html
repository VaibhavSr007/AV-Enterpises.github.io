        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><img class="rounded mt-4 text-center w-50" src="/static/css/ssc.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <p class="mt-4">Sartaj Singh Cheema has a family legacy of serving in armed forces. His father Col. SS Cheema served as CO of 72 armoured in 90's where as his grandfather retd. col. SS Cheema also served as CO of same 72 armoured corp in 70's. It was his dream from very begining to carry on the family legacy and be the next SS Cheema to command 72 armoured.
            <br><br>
            He completed his studies from Army Public School, Lucknow and along the way prepared for NDA(National Defence Academy) exam. He gave his best but unfotunately he was unable to clear the exam. Soon after results for 12th boards exam came and he scored exceptional in that. Now these marks opened an opportunity of Technical Entry Scheme (TES) entry for him.
            <br><br>
            Soon After confirming his eligibilty he started to drill for the process. Made a tough schedule followed it religiously and aimed to stop only when the goal is achieved.
            <br><br>
            Cheema was born and brought up in an environmnet best for any boy to imbibe offcer qualities. Over that in the years he had lived the life of officer by observing his father and grandfather. But with changing time he knew it would not be easy to comptete with others. So he made strategy and divided the assessment in four parts Psychology, Screening, GTO and Interview.
            <br><br>
            For each part he dedicated a regular time everday, in screening for OIR(Officer Intelligence Rating) he followed booklets of SSB crack and for PPDT (picture perception and description) test he took most famous images from internet and practised framing stories in timed manner. For 2nd part, psychology he followed youtube resources to get overview of all at start than practised.
            <br><br>
            Now for third part, GTO he went on and utilized grounds of cantonment and took support of a local coaching institute to improve his group behaviour and enhace group interaction skils. For the last and fourth part i.e personal interviews he took his father and grandfathers help. He got himself interviewed from them frequenty and worked to improve shortcoming regularly.
            <br><br>
            Finally by doing all these consistently for given period of time he was confident that he will crack the SSB interview. And the day of judgement arrived on 1st september 2020, where his hardwork made him stand among 9 reccomended candidates out of 383. Alas he is living his dream and became a defence dreamer to an amry officer.
