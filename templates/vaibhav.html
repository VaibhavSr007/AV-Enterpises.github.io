        <p class="mt-4">SSB is all about revealing your best selves to the assessers and if your best selves hold those officers like qualities, no one can stop you. <br><br>
        In my whole family there is no one nearly serving in armed forces, so i always wanted to be a change and first one to start a legacy of serving in armed in my family. Just after my 10th  standard i was very clear about what i have to do after my 12th. I had set the goal for me and started to act accordingly, i joined NCC in 11th standard and its traning made my mind more determined towards my goal. Everytime i visited cantonment for NCC works i used to get goosebumps watching those big statues of great martyrs and Gorkha Rifles jawan's trainig. Now in my mind there was nothing that could stop me from getting those olives. <br><br>
      Coming from civilian background i had no idea how to begin so i joined a defence coahing and started preparation for my NDA-143 exam. My preparation was going good till the forms for TES-42 came and was i called for SSB. It was a great feeling for me to recieve a formal invitation from armed forces, i took it very seriously and side-tracked my NDA exams preparation. Now i started to prepare for SSB interview in the same coaching, in 2 weeks i got aware with the full 5 day procedure and after that i took steering wheel in my hands. I used to prepare for psychology tests from my own and practise the stories from google in time framed manner, used SSB cracks psychology sheets for WAT and SRT preparation and for self description test i referred other succesful candidates SD and prepared mine accordingly.<br><br>
      Now for personel Interview i started with preparing everything  wrote in my PIQ, once i got thorough with that i gathered knowledge about the armed forces, current happenings and general awareness. Now i felt it was enough to start with mock interviews, so i got them scheduled with the assessers of coaching. Everytime a give interview i used to jort down my shortcomings and used to work on them. <br><br>
      For my GTO part i took help of friends i made in coaching and gathered them inmy home to conduct GD's, PPDT sessions, GPE and all other group related tests. This worked for all the candidates preparing in the group. This all was followed for a period of 3 months and felt bit confident that i'll crack the process. <br><br>
      Finally my the D-Day was here and results was going to be announced, i was pretty sure i'm not going to qualify because my personal interview did not go as per my expections. But miracle happened at that hour and my chest no. was called out, i was among the 9 candidates out of 383 reported aspirants. It was like a dream going on nothing felt real untill the officer called my name again and i went to stand with reccomended candidates. <br><br>
      Everything was going as per my plan but God had something else written for me. I got medically unfit and was unable join the academy despite of securing AIR-83. I was sad and was not ready to give the NDA-144 exam which was scheduled 8 days later. Somehow i picked myself up and went to write the exam, i know i was not going to clear it but i also knew this exam will become a base experiance for my last NDA attempt. <br><br>
      Now my sole focus was on NDA-145 written exam, i took help from my friends got aware with the strategies used by them and moulded them according to my demands. Literally the preparation for written exam felt harder than that of SSB. I used to set weekly and monthly targets and work relentlessly to achieve them. Once my syllabus was completed i started the streak of mock tests, in many of those i performed misrable and got much demoralized. Still i never gave up and kept on learning from my previous mistakes. Time came when i started to clear the cut-off and my confident was high. Finally after giving number of mocks i started to feel confident and gave the exam. Results of written exam came i was sure that i'll pass as i had checked my answers prior from answer keys. <br><br>
      Now again i had SSB to prepare, this time also my friend circle came to rescue and we again stared our group SSB prepearation. This time we were more experianced, knowledgeable and had strategies to follow up. We worked on our skills continuosly and cleared all the shortcomings coming in the way. Since i had a tag of "previously reccomended" my confidence was even high. I not just leaned from others goodness but also obersved what not to do in many cases. Preparation of SSB was almost done in 2 months and SSB came. I reported to 19 SSB Allahabad on 11th December 2020 and got screened in with bit of rush in GD round of PPDT. This time my personal interview, GTO and Psych all went as per my expections. I was expecting a posit9ve result from but also knew well that SSB is known for its surpises. Alas results of SSB was announced i was called on 3rd number among the 6 reccomended candidates. <br>
      Finally at that instance of my life i felt one thing <strong> "Nothing literally nothing is impossible if you are determined to achieve it"</strong>. <br>
      That day i felt im not just an ordinary boy, i'm meant to achieve and i will achieve 
      <strong> I have all qualities to be an army officer and i'm going act like one wherever i go in my life.</strong>
